## Note
A forewarning, I am very new to electronics design in general I apologies in advance for any really baffeling design desisions. I hope to learn using these projects and will keep them updated as I learn more. Thank you for your patience.

# What is FrameWork?
FrameWork is intended to be a open source bundle of different hardware periferals built around (but not always exclusive to) the steam frame. I feel the steam frame is the first VR headset that is truly open to the same extent to somthing like a desktop pc is, and feel this can be a huge turning point for VR hardware in general. Its clear that valve beleives that the community can be a powerful part of driving inovation and play a greater role in shaping what they do in ways other then just giving feedback. The inlcusion of expansion ports in the front and the general modularity of the headsets design shows that this customizability was clearly a core desgin pillar for them and I would hate to see it go to waste. While Im sure there will be plenty of moduals made by valve themselves as well as 3rd party venders I want to create a collection of hardware design to work with the frame that people can give feedback on, expand, and even take and create somthing entirly new all the while giveing back to the community further. I plan to host everthing pertaining to these devices including source files, STLs, and productions files allowing people to build them and have full control over them.
